## Introduction

Before smartphones transformed into essential tools for daily life, entertainment options were straightforward, particularly in the era of basic cellular phones. The rise in cellular phone usage during the 1990s marked the birth of mobile gaming, introducing a new medium of entertainment to a wide audience. Iconic games like "Snake," which debuted on Nokia devices, caught the interest of millions and laid the groundwork for mobile gaming.

Inspired by this history, our Unity project aims to fuse the nostalgic feel of classic games like "City Bloxx," "Tetris," and "Tricky Towers" into a modern gaming experience. This project seeks to recapture the simplicity and addictive nature of these classics while introducing modernized gameplay elements anchored in today's technology. The game shall offer a combination of building mechanics, puzzle-solving, and real-time physics, offering players a fresh challenge that is both nostalgic and distinctly contemporary.

## Project Overview

- **Game Type**: Strategy and Puzzle
- **Platform**: Windows (Desktop)
- **Theme**: Urban construction and city building
- **Game Mode**: Single Player
- **Objective**: 
  Players aim to construct towering and stable structures by strategically placing Tetris-like blocks within a city-building simulation environment, timing their placement with precision.

### Description
TetraCity is a strategy and puzzle game inspired by the building elements of "City Bloxx," the block manipulation of "Tetris," and the physics challenges of "Tricky Towers." The gameplay is centered around the 'Build a City' mode where players must construct high-rise buildings by placing various shaped blocks with care and precision. Each completed building is then placed on a single block grid that contributes to the development of a city.

Real-time physics are integrated into the gameplay, introducing variables that can sway, topple, or strengthen structures depending on how blocks are aligned. TetraCity offers a straightforward yet challenging experience, ideal for those who enjoy strategy games and city-building simulations.

## Game Details

The player's view is similar to "Tetris," with blocks coming from above in a claw. 

Players can reserve or swap blocks and must carefully stack them due to the real-time physics, which may cause structures to sway and fall.

## ASSETS
The game project utilized free assets from the Unity Asset Store, including the [Free Low Poly Simple Urban City 3D Asset Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/free-low-poly-simple-urban-city-3d-asset-pack-239474) by [DraftPunk Studios](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/30999) for building models, and the [2D Casual UI HD package](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/2d-casual-ui-hd-82080) by [MiMU Studio](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/20972) for buttons and other UI elements. Additionally, a [claw](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/claw-crane-game-edc71fb2fbf74a42bac0b84b9c5c2d2a) sprite model created by [hnl714](https://sketchfab.com/hnl714) was used. These assets were customized to accurately emulate the essential shapes and designs needed for the game.
